I envision a welcoming, whimsical workspace for parents, where every step feels intuitive, joyful, and deeply customizable. Here’s how it should flow:

1. Landing Experience
Parents are greeted by a friendly mascot and a playful, hand-drawn interface.
A brief, gentle onboarding animation or tooltip introduces the customization process.
2. Customization Panel (Sidebar or Modal)
Dropdown Menus (with icons and playful labels) guide the parent through these steps:
a. Select Grade Level
Dropdown with all grades: Pre-K, K, 1–12, plus multi-age or “custom” options.
Option for “multiple children” to generate differentiated sets.
b. Choose Subject
Dropdown or grid with dozens of subjects, grouped logically:
Core Academics: Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies, etc.
Enrichment: Art, Music, PE, Technology, Languages, etc.
Life Skills: Financial Literacy, Home Economics, Gardening, etc.
Bible & Christian Studies: Bible, Christian Living, Apologetics, etc.
c. Subcategory/Topic
Dynamically populates based on subject (e.g., “Fractions,” “Grammar: Parts of Speech,” “Earth Science: Weather”).
Search bar for quick topic finding.
d. Number of Problems/Activities
Numeric input or slider (e.g., 5–50 problems), with playful visual feedback (e.g., a stack of papers grows/shrinks).
e. Scaffolding Needed?
Toggle or dropdown:
None
Minimal hints
Step-by-step guides
Visual supports (number lines, diagrams, etc.)
f. Differentiation
Toggle or dropdown:
Standard
Challenge/extension problems
Remediation/review level
Option to generate multiple versions for different ability levels
g. Christian Content Slider
Visually engaging slider (e.g., from “Secular” to “Gently Christian” to “Richly Biblical”)
Tooltip or popover explains what each level means:
Secular: No explicit Christian content
Gently Christian: Occasional scripture, positive biblical worldview
Richly Biblical: Scripture, faith integration, Christian application throughout
h. State/Standard Alignment
Dropdown for state (or country), auto-selects relevant standards.
Option to select specific standards if desired.
i. Worksheet Style
Toggle between “Whimsical,” “Minimalist,” or “Classic.”
Preview thumbnail updates in real time.
j. Other Options
Time estimate (short, medium, long worksheet)
Print format (full page, half page, flashcards)
Language/translation toggle
